## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
source("main.r")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
india_data <- combined_data %>%
  filter(Country == "India")

ggplot(india_data, aes(x = year, y = GDP_per_capita)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  expand_limits(y = 0) +
  labs(title = "GDP Per Capita Over Time in India", x = "Year", y = "GDP per capita (US$)")
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
